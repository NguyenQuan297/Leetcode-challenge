# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

**Topic:** [Array](../) · **Difficulty:** Medium

## Description

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in **ascending order** (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) so that the array becomes  
`[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], ..., nums[k-1]]`.

Given `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the **index** of `target` if it is in `nums`, or **-1** if it is not.

You must write an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

- Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 0`
- Output: `4`

**Example 2:**

- Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 3`
- Output: `-1`

**Example 3:**

- Input: `nums = [1]`, `target = 0`
- Output: `-1`

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is a sorted array that was possibly rotated.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
